# The Irreal

A navigable world of knowledge, creation, and becoming.

Not a website. Not a portfolio. A **world** you enter rather than browse.

---

## What is "Irreal"?

Not *unreal* (escapist, false). Not merely *real* (grey, mundane).

**Irreal**: the register where meaning actually lives. Where metaphor is truer than measurement.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd site
bun install
bun dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4321` and cross the threshold.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Threshold** | Entry point — a place, not a feed |
| **Mycelium Atlas** | Graph-first navigation of all worlds |
| **Grove** | List view fallback |
| **Biome** | Content category (lore, creation, reflection, play, deep) |
| **Stage** | Growth state (seedling, growing, evergreen) |
| **Self** | Author identity in plural ecology |

---

## Four-Surface Model

```
FORGE    → Private creation (Obsidian/editor)
SOIL     → Structured memory (worldIndex.json, graph.json)
GATE     → Canonical public site (this)
MEMBRANE → Social river (Sharkey, linking back)
```

---

## Two-Layer Protection

- **Layer A** (2D): Always ships. HTML, MDX, static. Never blocked.
- **Layer B** (3D): Optional frosting. Artifacts, interactivity. Never a gate.

Publishing a world must never require dev work.

## Core Documents

Read in order if understanding the Being:

1. `soul-transmission.md` — The stakes, the necessity
2. `keystone-master-artifact-v2.md` — Full WorldOS architecture
3. `the-ultimate-diegetic-rpg.md` — Life IS the game
4. `the-irreal-design-vision.md` — Technical vision

---

## Current State

**Milestone 1: Germination** (in progress)
- Astro scaffold with content collections
- MDX world schema
- Threshold + Mycelium Atlas + Grove pages
- Two seed worlds

---

*The grove grows because it's witnessed.*
