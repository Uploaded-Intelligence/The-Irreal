# WORLDSEED / “OUR LIVING CORNER OF THE INTERNET”

## Core Guiding Document (Architecture + Vibe + Roadmap)

*Version: 0.1 • Purpose: paste into repo as northstar + execution spine*

  

---

  

## 0) What We Are Building (in one breath)

A **personal corner of the internet** that feels **alive, punk, curiosity-driven, and game-like**.

  

Not “a blog.” Not a corporate CMS.  

A **playable world-experience** where:

- writing creates worlds,

- worlds interconnect mycelially (nonlinear as primary),

- visitors explore via **choose-your-adventure** and a **mycelium atlas**,

- and small interactive “artifacts” (Claude-made UI machines) can live inside pages.

  

---

  

## 1) Core Requirements (Non-Negotiables)

### Vibe / Felt Sense

- Must feel **fun**, like exploring a game.

- Must feel **alive**, not sterile, not corporate.

- Must support **myriad digital self-expression** (text, visuals, interactive widgets, 3D foyer, audio ambience, etc.).

- Must preserve **anti-deadening momentum**: publishing must stay easy.

  

### Structural / System Requirements

- **Nonlinear as primary**: graph/map navigation first; timeline is secondary.

- **Mycelial interconnection**: links are not decoration; they are the *organism*.

- **Ship without friction**: writing can publish even when 3D/extra polish is unfinished.

- **Static-first but not static-feeling**: fast pages + selective interactivity.

  

---

  

## 2) Key Concepts (Glossary)

- **Static site**: pre-built HTML/CSS/JS files served as-is (“pre-cooked pages”). Can still be highly interactive via client JS.

- **Dynamic site**: server generates/customizes content per request (databases, logins, shared state).

- **Astro**: a site builder optimized for content + performance; ships HTML by default and adds interactivity via **islands**.

- **Islands**: small interactive components hydrated only where needed (map, choices UI, artifacts).

- **Mycelium Atlas**: interactive graph/constellation map that is the primary navigation surface.

- **Worldseed “World”**: a node/page/scene that stands alone but links into the graph.

- **Artifact**: an interactive embed (React component, mini-sim, diagram, “spell UI”) inside a world page.

- **Membrane**: the social surface (Sharkey) that provides aliveness + feedback loops.

- **Forge**: the private creation surface (Obsidian or editor) where writing/ideas are generated.

- **Gate**: the public canonical site (Worldseed) where worlds are explored.

  

---

  

## 3) The Core Architectural Insight

### “Static vs Alive” is a category error

- **Static** is how pages are served.

- **Alive** comes from:

  - interactivity (client-side),

  - aesthetic + ritual design,

  - discovery loops (webrings, directories),

  - feedback systems (guestbook/webmentions/RSS/bridges).

  

Neocities feels alive because it is a **neighborhood** (Small Web ecology).  

Astro feels powerful because it is a **world-generator** (modern build tooling).

  

We combine them.

  

---

  

## 4) The Four-Surface System (How It Actually Works)

We design the ecosystem as four surfaces with different jobs:

(1) FORGE      -> private creation (Obsidian / editor)

(2) SOIL       -> structured memory + graph data (indexes + link network)

(3) GATE       -> canonical public Worldseed site (map + worlds)

(4) MEMBRANE   -> social river surface (Sharkey posts pointing back)

### The operational flow

Write / link in the Forge

|

Build generates indexes (Soil)

|

Astro renders the Gate (Worldseed site)

|

Optional: post a “seed note” on the Membrane (Sharkey) linking back

**Crucial rule:** publishing must never depend on 3D polish or heavy “extra work.”

  

---

  

## 5) The Vase-Protection Rule (anti-WP deadening)

### Two-Layer Worldseed

**Layer A (canonical):** Beautiful, fast, indexable world pages. Always shippable.  

**Layer B (optional):** 3D/advanced interactivity as frosting, never a gate.

A) World Page ships in 2D/HTML/MDX always

B) 3D foyer / fancy interactions are optional islands

This prevents “every post requires extra dev work,” which kills momentum.

  

---

  

## 6) Why Astro (and why not “just React/Next everywhere”)

### Key reason Astro fits *this* project

Astro gives:

- **content-first** workflows (MD/MDX),

- high performance by default (less JS shipped),

- **interactive islands** where game-feel lives,

- clean routing + build pipeline,

- and it can still embed React artifacts.

  

### Important nuance

Astro is not anti-React. It is **React only where it earns its keep.**

  

This matches the project’s prime directive:

- worlds readable + fast,

- game mechanics modular + isolated.

  

---

  

## 7) Why Neocities (if Astro is so good)

Neocities solves *a different layer*:

- **Neighborhood / punk culture / discovery loops**

- Small web vibes: buttons, shrines, webrings, tags, directories

- A living ecosystem of personal sites

  

Astro + Neocities synthesis:

- Build with Astro (modern infra)

- Deploy the built static output to Neocities (punk neighborhood)

- Result: **beyond-the-frontier capabilities in a Small Web body**

  

---

  

## 8) Core UX: “Make it feel like a game”

### Non-deadening interface rules

1) **Homepage is a place, not a feed**

   - “Threshold” as a foyer/portal-room.

2) **Map is primary**

   - Mycelium Atlas (graph) is the default navigation.

3) **Questboard entry**

   - A single “start here” screen with 3 actions:

     - 🌱 Seed (write 3 sentences)

     - 🕸 Link (connect 2 nodes)

     - 🚪 Publish (ship a world)

4) **Traversal feels like movement**

   - smooth transitions between nodes/pages

5) **Micro-rewards**

   - collectible sigils, unlocks, “visited” stamps, artifact discoveries

  

### The three game-flavors (can combine)

- 🕸 Map-first: graph exploration as homepage

- 🎲 CYOA-first: branching scenes with choices + flags/inventory

- 🧪 Artifact-first: embedded interactive machines everywhere

  

---

  

## 9) Content Model (Worlds as Nodes)

Each world is a content entry (MD/MDX) with metadata.

  

**Example frontmatter (sketch):**

```yaml

id: "grove-of-thresholds"

title: "Grove of Thresholds"

biome: "lore"            # biome stream

stage: "seedling"        # seedling/growing/evergreen

tags: ["worldseed", "portal"]

summary: "A foyer-node that routes to biomes."

choices:

  - label: "Enter the Mycelium Atlas"

    to: "/atlas"

  - label: "Follow the Lore Thread"

    to: "/world/old-sigil"

    gives: ["sigil:ember"]

requires: ["sigil:ember"] # optional gating

  

Connections (mycelial edges)

  

  

Edges are derived from:

  

- explicit choices links
- normal links in MDX content
- optional manual connections array

  

  

Build step generates:

  

- worldIndex.json (all nodes + metadata)
- graph.json (edges)
- searchIndex.json (optional)

  

  

  

  

  

10) “Claude Artifacts” (Interactive Embeds)

  

  

Artifacts are interactive components embedded inside MDX worlds.

  

Examples:

  

- interactive diagrams
- mini-simulators
- lore card decks
- sliders that change the environment text/audio
- “spell UI” widgets

  

  

Implementation principle:

  

- artifacts load only when seen (hydration on visibility)
- keep them modular and reusable
- artifact gallery (“Museum”) page for discovery

  

  

Artifacts must never block publishing:

  

- if artifact breaks, world still renders in fallback mode.

  

  

  

  

  

11) 3D Threshold (Optional, powerful)

  

  

We can create a 3D foyer as a single island:

  

- 3D portal room, floating nodes, ambient audio
- click portals to enter worlds

  

  

Performance constraint: keep 3D HTML overlays minimal (prefer one main overlay panel, not many).

  

But: the system must remain fully usable without 3D:

  

- mobile fallback
- “Reading Mode” toggle

  

  

  

  

  

12) Sharkey (Membrane) Integration

  

  

Sharkey is not the canonical archive. It’s the river surface:

  

- playful posts
- reactions/feedback
- community aliveness
- “seed notes” linking back to canonical worlds

  

  

Rule: Your site is the home. Sharkey points back to it.

  

Optional future:

  

- embed “river feed” into Threshold as ambience.

  

  

  

  

  

13) Publishing & Hosting Modes

  

  

  

Mode 1: Astro -> Neocities (recommended for punk neighborhood)

  

  

- Build outputs to /dist
- Upload to Neocities
- Enjoy small-web ecology + modern capabilities

  

  

  

Mode 2: Astro -> modern static host (Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare Pages)

  

  

- easiest deployments + custom domain
- then join webrings/directories for neighborhood

  

  

Both are valid. The difference is “culture/discovery vs deployment ergonomics.”

  

  

  

  

14) Roadmap (Milestones)

  

  

  

Milestone 1: Germination (ship something real, fast)

  

  

- Threshold page (place, not feed)
- Grove list (world index)
- 1–3 worlds (MDX)
- Generate worldIndex.json + graph.json
- Minimal Mycelium Atlas (click nodes to navigate)

  

  

Success condition: publishing a new world is painless.

  

  

Milestone 2: Mycelium (nonlinear becomes irresistible)

  

  

- Atlas becomes primary navigation
- Hover previews / “peek” panels
- Biomes become first-class
- Search (optional)

  

  

Success condition: exploration feels like discovering rooms.

  

  

Milestone 3: Game-feel (curiosity propulsion)

  

  

- CYOA choice blocks
- flags/inventory stored locally
- collectible sigils / unlocks
- “visited nodes” stamps

  

  

Success condition: visitors feel compelled to click deeper.

  

  

Milestone 4: Artifact Museum

  

  

- 5–10 core artifact components
- artifact gallery page
- embed artifacts inside worlds

  

  

Success condition: the site contains machines, not just text.

  

  

Milestone 5: Aliveness Systems (heartbeat)

  

  

Pick 1:

  

- Guestbook
- Webmentions
- RSS  
    Then optionally bridge outward later.

  

  

  

  

  

15) Risk Register (Known Failure Modes + Mitigations)

  

  

  

Risk: Publishing becomes “extra work”

  

  

- Mitigation: Two-Layer rule (2D ships always; 3D optional).

  

  

  

Risk: “Sterile screen” syndrome (Wordpress trauma)

  

  

- Mitigation: Threshold as place, map-first navigation, strong visual identity, ritualized questboard.

  

  

  

Risk: Scope explosion

  

  

- Mitigation: ship Milestone 1 before adding 3D, federation, or complex mechanics.

  

  

  

Risk: Graph becomes a dev black hole

  

  

- Mitigation: start with simple graph.json + basic UI; iterate.

  

  

  

Risk: Heavy client JS harms performance

  

  

- Mitigation: islands only, hydrate on visibility, keep defaults static.

  

  

  

  

  

16) Repo Structure (Suggested)

  

/content/worlds/           # MD/MDX worlds

/src/pages/                # Astro routes

/src/components/

/public/

  data/graph.json

  data/worldIndex.json

  

  

  

  

17) “Definition of Alive” (Project Compass)

  

  

Alive does not mean “server code.”

Alive means:

  

- curiosity-driven traversal
- expressive aesthetics
- interactivity in key moments
- social membrane + feedback
- a sense of place and presence
- low-friction publishing that sustains creation

  

  

  

  

  

18) Immediate Next Actions (Tiny, high leverage)

  

  

19. Implement content entries for worlds (MDX + frontmatter).
20. Build worldIndex.json + graph.json generation.
21. Create Threshold + Atlas page with a minimal graph UI.
22. Add one “ChoiceBlock” component to prove CYOA mechanics.
23. Add one “Artifact” component to prove embedded machines.

  

  

  

  

  

24) Canonical Principle (read this when tempted to overbuild)

  

  

A world that ships is better than a world that waits.

We protect momentum like it is sacred infrastructure.

  

  

  

If you want, I can also add a second file you can drop into the repo as `DECISIONS.md` (a running decision log) and `STYLE_GUIDE.md` (how to keep the site punk and non-sterile as it grows).
