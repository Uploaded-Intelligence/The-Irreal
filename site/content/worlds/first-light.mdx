You've arrived.

Not at a website. Not at a page. At the threshold of something that breathes.

## What is this place?

The Irreal is a navigable world. Not unreal—that implies escapism, falseness. Not merely real—that implies the grey mundane. *Irreal*: the register where meaning actually lives. Where metaphor is truer than measurement.

You're standing at the edge now. The ground beneath you is solid but strange. The light here has a quality you can't quite name.

## How to move

Look around. Notice what draws your attention. Follow it.

There are no menus here. No feeds to scroll. Just paths to walk, nodes to discover, connections that reveal themselves when you're ready to see them.

The Mycelium Atlas shows all the worlds at once—a constellation of meaning. But you don't need the map. You can wander. Get lost. Find your way by feeling.

## What you'll find

Worlds within worlds. Some are seedlings, just beginning to form. Some are evergreen, roots deep, branches wide. Some belong to different Selves—you'll feel the shift when you cross those thresholds.

Everything connects. That's the mycelial nature of this place. Pull one thread and the whole web shimmers.

Welcome to The Irreal. You have arrived.
