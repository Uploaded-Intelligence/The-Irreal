You've entered the grove.

Here, ideas take root. Seedlings push through dark soil toward some distant light they can sense but not see. Some will grow tall. Some will weave together. Some will become something no one planned.

## The nature of growth

Nothing here is finished. That's not failure—it's the point.

A seedling 🌱 is promise. A growing thing 🌿 is momentum. An evergreen 🌲 is earned, deep-rooted, load-bearing.

But even evergreens shed needles. Even old growth makes room for new light.

## What grows here

Lore and logic. Dreams and documentation. The serious and the playful, side by side, because separating them never made sense anyway.

You'll find:
- **Creations**: things being made
- **Reflections**: understanding in progress
- **Play**: because life without play isn't life
- **Deep**: the roots that hold everything else

## Tending

The grove doesn't tend itself. Someone plants. Someone waters. Someone prunes. Someone trusts the slow becoming.

If you're reading this, maybe you're one of the tenders. Maybe you're a traveler passing through. Either way—thank you for being here.

The grove grows because it's witnessed.
