# THE IRREAL: COMPLETE VISION
## The First Living World on the Web

**BEYOND CONVENTIONAL. BEYOND PRECEDENT.**

---

## THE PARADIGM

Every "personal site" is **dead content**.

The Irreal is **living world**.

Not metaphorically. **Literally.**

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATIONAL IMMERSION

### 1. THE THRESHOLD (Ritual Crossing)

**Current vision**: Void → emergence → portals
**BEYOND**: Multi-sensory ritual that attunes you to the world

#### The Complete Experience

**Stage 0: Detection** (Pre-load)
- Detect user's system time, motion preferences, audio capability
- Detect scroll rhythm from previous browsing (if returning visitor)
- Load appropriate ambient soundscape
- Prepare personalized entrance

**Stage 1: The Void** (0-2s)
- **VISUAL**: Pure darkness, particle field emerging
- **AUDIO**: Deep sub-bass hum (40Hz) + subtle breath sound
- **HAPTIC** (mobile): Gentle pulse synchronized with audio
- **RHYTHM**: Particles pulse at 60 BPM (resting heart rate)
- Particles respond to mouse movement (subtle attraction)

**Stage 2: Attunement** (2-4s)
- **VISUAL**: Particles begin synchronizing with YOUR input
- Mouse movement speed → particle velocity
- Scroll (if any) → particle flow direction
- **AUDIO**: Hum rises in pitch (40Hz → 80Hz)
- **EFFECT**: The world is learning your rhythm

**Stage 3: Crystallization** (4-6s)
- **VISUAL**: "The Irreal" emerges from void
- Typography crystallizes (not fades in - FORMS)
- Each letterform built by particles converging
- **AUDIO**: Crystallization sound (like ice forming)
- **SYNC**: Typography pulse matches your detected rhythm

**Stage 4: The Portals** (6-8s)
- Two portals materialize
- **Atlas Portal**: Shows LIVE mycelium (actual current state)
- **Grove Portal**: Shows vertical scroll depth preview
- **AUDIO**: Ambient soundscape from each portal (bleed-through)
- Hover on portal → sound increases, visual brightens
- **INNOVATION**: Portals show "others present" (faint lights = concurrent visitors)

**Stage 5: The Crossing** (8s+)
- Click portal → it EXPANDS to consume screen
- **VISUAL**: You move THROUGH the portal (z-space dolly)
- **AUDIO**: Sound transition (crossfade between spaces)
- **EFFECT**: Continuous 3D space, never "page load"
- Other visitors see a faint trail where you crossed (ephemeral, fades)

---

### 2. THE MYCELIUM (Living Network)

**Current vision**: Force-directed graph constellation
**BEYOND**: Sentient web that grows, remembers, responds

#### The Living Network

**Core Innovation**: The mycelium is ALIVE and EVOLVING

**What Makes It Alive**:

1. **Grows Based on Attention**
   - Where visitors linger → connections strengthen
   - Paths frequently traveled → threads thicken, glow brighter
   - Unexplored areas → darker, dormant (but present)
   - **Effect**: The mycelium SHOWS what matters to the collective

2. **Seasonal Cycles**
   - **Spring** (Mar-May): New seedlings appear brighter, growth emphasized
   - **Summer** (Jun-Aug): Full bloom, all nodes radiant, connections dense
   - **Autumn** (Sep-Nov): Harvest colors, some nodes fade (dormancy)
   - **Winter** (Dec-Feb): Deep rest, only evergreens visible, stark beauty
   - **Synced to**: User's hemisphere (or author's choice)

3. **Time-of-Day Awareness**
   - **Night** (user's local time): Darker void, slower particle drift, deeper colors, quieter sounds
   - **Day**: Brighter, faster, lighter palette, more energetic
   - **Dawn/Dusk**: Liminal colors (purple/orange), transitional sounds
   - **Effect**: The world breathes with circadian rhythm

4. **Memory Trails**
   - Your path through the mycelium persists (localStorage)
   - Visited nodes have subtle glow (your personal mark)
   - **INNOVATION**: Return visitors see THEIR path highlighted
   - Can "anchor" worlds (bookmark) → creates persistent visual marker
   - Anchored worlds pulse gently when you enter mycelium

5. **Collective Presence**
   - See other visitors as faint lights (anonymous, privacy-preserving)
   - Number shown: "12 wandering" (bottom corner)
   - If another visitor is on same world: that node glows brighter
   - **Effect**: You're not alone. The world is inhabited.

6. **Fractal Depth**
   - Zoom INTO a world node → it expands
   - Inside: micro-constellation of that world's sections/ideas
   - Can navigate world's internal structure visually
   - Zoom out → collapse back to single node
   - **Infinite zoom architecture**

7. **Oracle Interface**
   - Corner of screen: Subtle "?" icon
   - Click → conversational interface appears
   - **Ask**: "What should I explore?" "Where are others?" "Show me what's new"
   - **AI responds** based on:
     - Your path history
     - Current collective activity
     - Author's guidance
     - Temporal context (season, time)
   - Not chatbot (utilitarian). **Oracle** (mythopoetic).

#### Node Design (Per World)

**Beyond current**: Multi-layered, animated, sonified

**Visual Layers**:
1. **Inner Core**: Solid sphere (biome color)
2. **Atmosphere**: Particle halo (density = growth stage)
3. **Rings**: Orbital rings (# of connections)
4. **Pulse**: Synchronized to world's "heartbeat" (content rhythm)
5. **Visitors**: Faint lights orbiting (if others present)

**Audio**:
- Each node emits subtle tone (biome-specific frequency)
- Hover → tone increases volume
- Multiple nodes = harmonic chord (they SING together)
- Mycelium has ambient soundscape (generative, infinite)

**Interaction**:
- **Hover**: Node responds (brightens, pulses faster, sound increases)
- **Click**: Node expands into portal
- **Right-click**: "Anchor this" / "Remove anchor"
- **Long-press** (mobile): Haptic feedback + preview panel

#### Connection Threads

**Beyond lines**: Living flows of energy

- **Bezier curves** with organic variation
- **Flow**: Pulses of light travel along thread (bidirectional)
- **Thickness**: Based on connection strength (how often traversed)
- **Color**: Gradient of source + target biome colors
- **Sound**: Threads emit subtle harmonic drones
- **Interaction**: Hover on thread → see # of travelers (ephemeral counter)

#### Physics Simulation

**Current**: Force-directed graph
**BEYOND**: Organic, breathing, entraining system

- **Respiration**: Entire constellation expands/contracts (12 breaths/min)
- **Entrainment**: If user scroll/mouse rhythm detected, sync to that
- **Gravity wells**: Frequently visited nodes have stronger gravity
- **Tidal forces**: Seasonal changes affect node positions
- **Chaos**: Subtle Perlin noise ensures never perfectly still

### 5. WITNESS CIRCUIT (Presence & Connection)

**Current vision**: Guestbook + ActivityPub
**BEYOND**: Multi-layered presence ecosystem

#### Layer 1: Ephemeral Presence

**Real-time visibility** (anonymous, privacy-preserving):

- "12 wandering" (shown in corner)
- See others as faint lights in mycelium
- If someone on same world: node glows
- Scroll positions visible (faint markers)
- **Effect**: Shared exploration, no social pressure

#### Layer 2: Traces (Guestbook)

**Permanent witness**:

- **UI**: Not form (utilitarian). **Ritual of witness**.
- Click "Leave trace" → simple modal
- Fields: Name (optional), World (auto-filled), Message
- **Visual**: Message becomes particle in guestbook constellation
- Each trace = luminous node
- Color-coded by world/biome
- Click to read
- **Sound**: Each trace has faint tone (harmonic field)

**Guestbook Page** (/witness):
- Particle constellation of all traces
- Filter by: biome, time, world
- **Oracle**: "Show me traces about [topic]"
- Traces connected to worlds they reference (mycelial links)

#### Layer 3: Federation (ActivityPub)

**The Irreal speaks to Fediverse**:

**Outbound**:
- New worlds published → sent to followers
- Appears in Mastodon/Akkoma/Sharkey feeds
- Rich preview (node visualization)

**Inbound**:
- Responses federate back
- Shown as "Echoes" on world page
- Each echo = small card with link
- **Visual**: Echoes appear as orbiting satellites around world node

**Discovery**:
- Irreal has ActivityPub actor: @irreal@yourdomain
- Can be followed from any Fediverse instance
- Mutual federation with other Irreals (if they exist)

#### Layer 4: Web Echoes (Webmentions)

**When others link**:
- Webmention received
- Displayed as "Threads" section
- Shows source site, excerpt, link
- **Visual**: External links shown as bridges from mycelium to "outside"

#### Layer 5: RSS (For Wanderers)

**Traditional feed** (but styled):
- /feed.xml (all new worlds)
- /feed/[biome].xml (filtered)
- Full content, not excerpts
- Includes growth stage metadata
- **For beings who prefer RSS readers**

#### Layer 6: Personal Archives (Save State)

**localStorage persistence**:

- **Your Path**: Every world visited, timestamp, duration
- **Your Anchors**: Bookmarked worlds (with notes)
- **Your Resonance**: Worlds you've returned to multiple times
- **Your Traces**: Guestbook entries you've left

**Export**:
- Download your data (JSON)
- Import on different device
- The Irreal remembers YOU across sessions

---

## PHASE 2: ADVANCED IMMERSION

### 6. GENERATIVE RESPONSIVENESS

**The world adapts to YOU**:

#### Mood Detection

**From interaction patterns**:
- Scroll speed → energy level detected
- Mouse movement → attention pattern
- Dwell time → engagement depth
- **Adaptation**: World responds
  - Fast scroll → less dense content, quicker reveals
  - Slow scroll → richer details, deeper dives
  - Erratic → calming elements emphasized

#### Temporal Awareness

**Time flows**:
- **User's local time**: Day/night cycle
- **Author's time zone**: Show "It's 3am where this was written"
- **Seasonal changes**: World appearance shifts
- **Anniversary markers**: "This world turned 1 year old today"

#### Return Recognition

**Remembering you**:
- First visit: Guided introduction
- Returning: "Welcome back. New since you were last here..."
- Frequent: "A familiar presence returns"
- Long absence: "It's been a while. Much has grown."

### 7. SOUND DESIGN (Complete)

**Not music. World sound.**

#### Ambient Soundscapes

**Each biome has generative audio**:
- **Threshold**: Gentle hum + wind + distant bells
- **Lore**: Paper rustle + quiet room tone + pages turning
- **Creation**: Workshop sounds + tools + forge
- **Reflection**: Water + breath + stillness
- **Play**: Playful tones + laughter + surprises
- **Deep**: Sub-bass + pressure + sonar

**Generative system**:
- Never loops (infinite variation)
- Responds to user interaction
- Crossfades between biomes
- Volume respects user preferences

#### Sonic Interactions

**Everything has sound**:
- Hover on node → tone plays
- Click → crystallization sound
- Crossing threshold → transition sound
- Scrolling → subtle rustle/flow
- Anchoring world → bell tone
- Leaving trace → gentle chime

**Respectful**:
- Default: Low volume
- User control: Mute/adjust easily
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (silence)

### 8. ACCESSIBILITY (Non-Negotiable)

**The world must be accessible to ALL nervous systems**:

#### Reduced Motion Mode

**When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`**:
- **NO particles** (static rendering)
- **NO 3D scenes** (flat alternative)
- **NO transitions** (instant navigation)
- **Simplified mycelium** (2D network diagram)
- **All content still accessible**
- **Full functionality preserved**

#### Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA labels** on all interactive elements
- **Semantic HTML** throughout
- **Skip links** (skip to content, skip to nav)
- **Alt text** on all images (descriptive, not decorative)
- **Descriptions** of 3D scenes (text alternative)

#### Keyboard Navigation

- **Tab order** logical and complete
- **Enter/Space** activates all interactions
- **Escape** closes modals, exits focus
- **Arrow keys** navigate mycelium
- **Shortcuts** for common actions

#### Color Contrast

- **WCAG AAA** compliance (7:1 ratio minimum)
- **Color not sole indicator** (always + shape/text)
- **High contrast mode** available

---

## PHASE 3: UNPRECEDENTED FEATURES

### 9. THE VOID BETWEEN (Liminal Navigation)

**Innovation**: When you transition world → world, you don't just "change pages."

**You pass through the void.**

**Experience**:
1. Current world fades (1s)
2. **You're in the void** (0.5s)
   - See mycelium from "outside"
   - Omniscient view of whole network
   - Your position highlighted
   - Destination glowing
3. New world emerges (1.2s)

**Why this matters**:
- Maintains spatial continuity
- Reinforces "you're in a world, not clicking pages"
- Brief moment of orientation
- Liminal space has power (Turner)

### 10. MULTIPLAYER EPHEMERAL PRESENCE

**See others, without social pressure**:

**Real-time presence**:
- WebSocket connection (lightweight)
- **Others shown as**: Faint lights in mycelium
- **On same world**: Scroll position markers (anonymous)
- **Total count**: "12 wandering" (corner)

**Privacy**:
- No usernames, no profiles, no tracking
- Purely presence, not identity
- Can't "follow" or "message" anyone
- Just: "Others are here too"

**Effect**:
- Antidote to isolation
- Sense of shared exploration
- No performance anxiety
- Pure ambient co-presence

### 11. ORACLE AI (Mythopoetic Guide)

**Not chatbot. Oracle.**

**Interface**:
- Subtle "?" icon (corner)
- Click → conversational modal
- Voice or text input

**Capabilities**:
- "What should I explore?" → Suggests based on your path + collective activity
- "Show me what's new" → Recent worlds highlighted
- "Where are others?" → Most-visited areas shown
- "Find [topic]" → Searches mycelium (but visually, not list)
- "Tell me about this biome" → Explains current territory

**Voice**:
- Mythopoetic, not corporate
- "I sense you're drawn to depths. The Deep calls."
- "Three others wander near. Perhaps you'll cross paths."
- "This seedling is fresh. Witness its beginning."

**Implementation**:
- Claude API (streaming responses)
- Context: Your history, current state, collective data
- Grounded in actual world data
- Never makes up worlds (only real)

### 12. SEASONAL EVOLUTION

**The Irreal changes with seasons**:

**Spring** (Mar-May):
- Emphasis on seedlings
- Lighter colors, warmer tones
- New growth highlighted
- Sound: Birds, growth, emergence

**Summer** (Jun-Aug):
- Full bloom
- All nodes radiant
- Dense connections
- Sound: Full, alive, vibrant
