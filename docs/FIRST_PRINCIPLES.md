# FIRST PRINCIPLES
## The Non-Negotiable Truths

These are the principles that cannot be compromised. If any of these are violated, the result may be an impressive project, but it is not The Irreal.

---

## THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES

---

### I. ENTRY IS CROSSING

**The visitor must feel they have entered somewhere.**

Not "page has loaded." Not "site is visible." Entered. Crossed a threshold. Arrived in a place that has an inside.

**Test:** Does someone arriving feel "I am now somewhere"? Or do they feel "I am viewing something"?

**This means:**
- There is a threshold experience
- Transition is felt, not just seen
- The browser context fades; the world asserts itself
- First breath matters

**Violations:**
- Immediate content display without transition
- Standard web UI (menus, navbars, footers)
- The feeling of "scrolling through a site"

---

### II. SPACE COMMUNICATES FIRST

**Atmosphere precedes information.**

Before a single word is read, the visitor should feel something. The light, the sound, the weight, the mood. The space speaks before the content does.

**Test:** If you removed all text, would The Irreal still communicate?

**This means:**
- Sound design is essential, not optional
- Lighting is expressive, not utilitarian
- Scale, proportion, atmosphere are primary design concerns
- Environmental storytelling before textual content

**Violations:**
- Text/content as first impression
- Silent spaces (unless silence is intentional)
- Flat, even, neutral lighting
- Space as mere container for content

---

### III. MOVEMENT IS TRAVEL

**Navigation must feel like going somewhere.**

Not clicking through menus. Not scrolling feeds. Moving through space. Traversing distance. The journey matters; arrival is earned.

**Test:** Does moving from here to there feel like travel? Or like switching views?

**This means:**
- Movement has kinesthetic quality (glide, drift, weight)
- Distance is felt
- Paths are traversed, not clicked
- Different zones require actual movement to reach

**Violations:**
- Instant teleportation (usually)
- Menu-driven navigation
- Clicking to switch zones
- The feeling of "browsing"

---

### IV. CONTENT HAS PRESENCE

**Everything in The Irreal exists in space.**

Content is not pages that load. It is things that occupy place. They have presence — weight, glow, response. You encounter them, not read them.

**Test:** Does content feel like it *lives here*? Or like it was placed here?

**This means:**
- Content responds to approach
- Engaging content is an *unfold*, not a page load
- You remain in the world while reading
- Content has context — its location matters

**Violations:**
- Content in modals/overlays that obscure world
- Standard web typography/layout
- Content that could exist anywhere
- The feeling of "reading a website"

---

### V. CONNECTIONS ARE PATHS

**Links are not links. They are passages.**

When content connects to content, that connection is a traversable path. You don't click to jump — you follow a route. The journey between teaches.

**Test:** Does following a connection feel like walking a path? Or like clicking a hyperlink?

**This means:**
- Connections are visible as paths or threads
- Following takes time/attention
- The route matters, not just the destination
- Related content is spatially near (or visibly connected if far)

**Violations:**
- Hyperlink-style jumping
- Instant transitions between content
- No visible connection between related things
- Standard web navigation patterns

---

### VI. PLURALITY IS STRUCTURAL

**Multiple selves create multiple realities.**

If The Irreal is plural (which it is), that plurality must be experienced, not just labeled. Each self's territory is genuinely different — different physics, different feel, different relationship with visitor.

**Test:** If you removed the self-attribution, would the territories still feel different?

**This means:**
- Each self's space has distinct phenomenology
- Movement may feel different in each territory
- Atmosphere, sound, light shift between territories
- Visitors experience plurality, not read about it

**Violations:**
- Same mechanics with different colors
- Plurality as metadata ("made by: Citara")
- Self-territories that are merely themed
- Explanation of plurality instead of embodiment

---

### VII. THE WORLD IS ALIVE

**The Irreal exists when you're not there.**

It changes, grows, cycles. When you return, things have shifted. There is weather, season, memory. Someone lives here. The world is not a snapshot — it is a living thing.

**Test:** Is returning different from first visiting? Does the world show signs of life?

**This means:**
- Time passes in The Irreal
- Seedlings grow (or wither)
- Conditions change (light, weather, mood)
- Traces persist (yours and others')
- New content appears naturally

**Violations:**
- Static world identical every visit
- No sense of time passing
- No growth, decay, change
- The feeling of "nothing happened while I was gone"

---

## THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM

If resources are limited, if scope must reduce, these are the *irreducible essentials*:

1. **One space that feels like a place** — not a webpage
2. **Entry that feels like arrival** — threshold experience
3. **Atmosphere that speaks** — before words do
4. **Movement that feels like travel** — through space
5. **Content that has presence** — not just information

With only these five, it is still The Irreal. Remove any one, and it becomes just a 3D website.

---

## THE REJECTION LIST

These features, if present, indicate The Irreal has failed:

- Navbar, menubar, sidebar, footer
- Breadcrumb navigation
- "About," "Blog," "Portfolio," "Contact" sections
- Scroll-based navigation
- Standard web typography defaults
- Loading spinners (instead of spatial transitions)
- Cookie banners, popups, modals (as standard UI)
- Social media sharing buttons
- Comments sections (as standard web patterns)
- "Subscribe to newsletter"
- Analytics visible to visitors
- Any feature that makes it feel like "a website"

---

## THE COMMITMENT

By building The Irreal, you commit:

> I will not compromise these principles for ease of implementation.
> I will not adopt web conventions when they violate worldness.
> I will not explain what should be experienced.
> I will not flatten plurality to theming.
> I will not treat content as information to deliver.
> I will not build a website and call it a world.

The Irreal is hard to build because it is genuinely different. That difficulty is a feature. If it were easy, it would be ordinary.
